    CSS gives you an opportunity to create layers of various divisions. The CSS 
layers refer to applying the z-index property to elements that overlap with each 
other.
The z-index property is used along with the position property to create an effect 
of layers. You can specify which element should come on top and which element 
should come at bottom.
A z-index property can help you to create more complex webpage layouts. The 
following example shows how to create layers in CSS.
