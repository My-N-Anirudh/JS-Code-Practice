    A property called visibility allows you to hide an element from view. You can use 
this property along with JavaScript to create very complex menu and very 
complex webpage layouts.
You may choose to use the visibility property to hide error messages that are 
only displayed if the user needs to see them, or to hide answers to a quiz until 
the user selects an option.
NOTE: Remember that the source code will still contain whatever is in the 
invisible paragraph, so you should not use this to hide sensitive information such 
as credit card details or passwords.
The visibility property can take the values listed in the table that follows:
Value Description
visible The box and its contents are shown to the user.
hidden The box and its content are made invisible, although they still affect 
the layout of the page.
collapse This is for use only with dynamic table columns and row effects.
